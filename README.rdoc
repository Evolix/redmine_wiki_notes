= Redmine Wiki Notes Plugin

== Plugin installation

1. Copy the plugin directory into the vendor/plugins directory
2. Restart Redmine

== Usage

The following macros are added:

* note
* tip
* important
* warning

which can be used in one of three ways:

   {{note(text with *wiki formatting*)}}

   {{note
   Alternately, you can put blocks of *wiki-formatted* text here.
   }}

   {{note(Or if you really want)
   You can do both...
   }}

This displays a block in the wiki page with a corresponding
icon and the specified text.
